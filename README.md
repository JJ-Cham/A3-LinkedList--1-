## Reflection

What do you see as the benefits and downsides of working with linked lists instead of arrays? When might they be most useful versus limiting?

One benefit of linked lists is that it’s easy to insert or remove elements in the middle of the list without having to shift everything around, like you would in an array. They can also grow or shrink in size without worrying about resizing or wasted space. The downside is that linked lists don’t allow fast random access like arrays do. If I want the 10th element, I have to start from the head and move through each node, which is slower.


What was the major challenge you faced in completing this assignment?

A major challenge was fixing bugs that were found after comiling or testing. Debugging those mistakes was tough because the list would sometimes just disappear or not behave the way I expected.

What do you feel you learned from this assignment?

I learned that the concepts are not really hard to understand it's really looking for resources to help with syntax and trying to understand how each portion works together. I also got practice with writing helper methods like getTail() and using exceptions to handle errors. Most importantly, I realized how important it is to carefully think through cases and test them.
